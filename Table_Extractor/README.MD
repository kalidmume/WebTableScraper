🧾 Example of Inside README.md (for WebTableScraper)

You can copy-paste this:

# 🧮 WebTableScraper (Basic → Standard)

This project scrapes tables (like Wikipedia lists) and saves them as CSV files.

---

## 🔹 Versions
- **basic_v1.py** → simple working version
- **standard_v2.py** → improved structure, multi-table support, clean data

---

## 🚀 How to Use
```bash
python basic_v1.py

Enter website URL when asked (example):

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_population

Then enter CSV file name (or press Enter for default).


---

📂 Output

Results saved to:

output/countries.csv


---

📘 Example

Name	Population	Continent

China	1,426,000,000	Asia
India	1,417,000,000	Asia



---

🧠 Notes

You can easily replace "wikitable" with any other class name.

Works with multiple tables per page.

Standard version adds cleaner text, regex cleanup, and better error handling.
